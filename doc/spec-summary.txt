A General Summary of Mars Rover Problem


Given there is a planet "Mars"
	And "Mars" has a 'rectangular' "plateau"
	And there is a space agency "NASA" 		
When "NASA" creates a "SpaceStation"
	And "NASA" creates "Rover" squad
	And sends "NaviagationCommands" to "SpaceStation" to control "Rover"
Then "Rover" should navigate plateau
	And Rover's "Camera" can take a photo
	And "Rover" can send photos to "NASA"
